# User Guide

## Basic Operations

### Summon Interface

By default, you can use the following global shortcut to summon the clipboard history panel:

- **macOS**: `Cmd + Shift + V`
- **Windows / Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + V`

> **Tip**: You can modify this shortcut in the application settings.

### List Navigation

To improve efficiency, we support multiple navigation methods so your hands don't have to leave the keyboard:

- **Move Up/Down**:
  - Arrow keys `↑` / `↓`
  - Vim style `j` (down) / `k` (up)
  - Emacs style `Ctrl+n` (down) / `Ctrl+p` (up)
- **Confirm/Paste**: Press `Enter` to paste the selected item into the current active window and automatically close the panel.
- **Preview Details**: Press `Space` to view detailed information of the currently selected item (useful for long text or large images). Press `Space` again to close the preview.
- **Close Panel**: Press `Esc`.

## Advanced Features

### Paste Stack (Queue)

The Paste Stack allows you to copy multiple items and paste them in a specific order. This is extremely useful for filling out forms or moving data between applications.

### New Features (2026)

- **Async OCR**: Text extraction from images is now fully async on Windows/macOS, ensuring no deadlocks or database lock issues.
- **History Protection**: When clearing history, pinned/collected items are protected by default and a confirmation dialog is shown.
- **Edit/Add Clipboard Items**: You can now add or edit text/code/url/email/phone items directly in the app (images not supported yet). Use the “Edit” or “Add” button in the main window.
- **Database Reliability**: All database operations are async, so the app remains responsive even during heavy OCR or history operations.
- **Tray & UI Sync**: Tray menu and main window always stay in sync for a seamless experience.

1.  **Select Items**:
    - **Keyboard**: Navigate to an item and press `x` to select/deselect it.
    - **Mouse**: Hold `Cmd` (macOS) or `Ctrl` (Windows) and click on items.
    - A numbered badge (e.g., ①, ②) will appear on selected items indicating the paste order.
2.  **Start Queue**: Press `Enter`. The first item will be copied to your clipboard, and the window will close.
3.  **Paste Sequentially**:
    - Paste the first item (`Cmd+V`).
    - Press the **Global Shortcut** (default `Cmd+Shift+V`) to automatically copy the _next_ item in the queue.
    - Repeat until the queue is empty.

### OCR (Text Extraction)

> **Note**: Currently available on macOS and Windows.

You can extract text from images stored in your clipboard history.

1.  Select an image item in the list.
2.  Press `Space` to open the preview.
3.  Click the **"Extract Text"** button at the bottom right.
4.  The extracted text will be copied to your clipboard and added as a new text item in your history.

### Compact Mode

For users who prefer a denser information view, you can enable **Compact Mode** in Settings. This mode:

- Reduces the height of each list item.
- Hides image previews in the list (showing `[Image]` text instead).
- Displays more items on the screen at once.

## Features

### Pinning Items

You can pin important items to the top of the list. Pinned items will:

- Always stay at the top of the history list.
- **Not be automatically deleted** even if the history size limit is reached.

To pin an item, hover over it and click the Pin icon, or use the context menu.

### Sensitive Data

You can mark items as "Sensitive". Sensitive items are:

- Encrypted in the database.
- Blurred in the UI until hovered.

> **Note**: Automatic detection of sensitive content (based on entropy) has been removed to prevent false positives. You can still configure "Sensitive Applications" in settings to ignore clipboard content from specific apps (like password managers).

## Search Function

There is a search box at the top of the panel. After opening the panel, type keywords directly to filter history records.

- Supports fuzzy search.
- Search scope includes text content and source application name.

## Data Management

### Storage Location

To ensure your data privacy, all data is stored locally on your device:

- **macOS**: `~/.clipboard-manager/`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<Username>\.clipboard-manager\`
- **Linux**: `~/.clipboard-manager/`

### Database Security

- The database file is named `history.db`.
- The database uses **AES-GCM** algorithm for encryption, and the key is stored in a local secure location. This means that even if someone obtains your database file, they cannot read its content without the key.

### Privacy Settings

In settings, you can:

- **Pause Recording**: Temporarily stop listening for clipboard changes.
- **Ignore Applications**: Add application names (e.g., `1Password`, `KeyChain`) that should not be recorded to protect sensitive information.
- **Clear History**: One-click delete all locally stored history records.
