# Development Guide

If you are a developer and want to contribute code to this project or build it yourself, please refer to the following guide.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern tech stack, balancing performance and development experience:

## Recent Features & Improvements

- **Async OCR Refactor**: Windows and macOS OCR logic is now fully async, preventing deadlocks and database lock issues.
- **Robust History Management**: History deletion now includes confirmation dialogs and protects pinned/collected items unless configured otherwise.
- **Advanced Item Editing**: You can add or edit text/code/url/email/phone clipboard items directly in the app (images not supported yet).
- **Database Reliability**: All database operations are now async, ensuring the database is never locked during heavy OCR or history operations.
- **Frontend/Backend Sync**: Tray menu and frontend state are always synchronized for a seamless experience.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, please ensure your development environment has the following tools installed:

1.  **Rust**: Please install the latest stable version via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
2.  **Node.js**: Recommended v18 or higher.
3.  **pnpm**: Package manager (`npm install -g pnpm`).
4.  **System Dependencies**:
    - **macOS**: Requires Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).
    - **Linux**: Requires `libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev`, `build-essential`, `curl`, `wget`, `libssl-dev`, `libgtk-3-dev`, `libayatana-appindicator3-dev`, etc.

## Quick Start

1.  **Clone Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tipsxBase/clipboard.git
    cd clipboard
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Start Development Mode**

    This command will start both the frontend development server and the Tauri backend, with hot reload enabled.

    ```bash
    pnpm tauri dev
    ```

## Build & Release

Build the production application bundle:

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

The build artifacts will be located in the `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/` directory.
